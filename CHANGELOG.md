# 0.12.0

Added a new feature: the ability to "invert" selections:

- A single item can be "inverted" (same as toggling it on/off).
- A file can be "inverted" (invert each match inside file)
- All matches can be "inverted" (every match is inverted)

This feature can be used with the `v` and `V` keys.
See the in-app help (`?`) for more.
